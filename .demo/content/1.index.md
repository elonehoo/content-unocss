## Usage

This template has some built-in features to make it as easy as possible to create a content-driven website.

### Pages

Create your Markdown pages in the `content/` directory:

```md
# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

You can overwrite meta tags by using front-matter:

```md
---
head.title: 'Custom <title>'
head.description: 'Custom meta description'
head.image: 'Custom image injected as `og:image`'
---

# My title

This first paragraph will be treated as the page meta description.
```

This is done thanks to the [`<ContentDoc>`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/content-doc) component of Nuxt Content.

### Navigation

The navigation is generated from your pages, you can take a look at the [`<Navbar>`](https://github.com/elonehoo/content-unocss/blob/main/theme/components/Navbar.vue) component to see how it works.

It uses the [`<ContentNavigation>`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/content-navigation) component from Nuxt Content to fetch the navigation object.

To customize the title displayed in the navigation, you can set the `navigation.title` property in the front-matter of your pages:

```md
---
navigation.title: 'Home'
---

# Welcome to my site

With a beautiful description
```

### Icons

Use any icon from [icones.js.org](https://icones.js.org) with the `<Icon>` component:

```html
<Icon name="ph:music-notes-fill" />
```

You can also use it in your Markdown:

```md
:icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}
```

Will result in :icon{name="ph:music-notes-fill"}

Learn more on [nuxt-icon](https://github.com/Atinux/nuxt-icon) documentation.

### Vue Components

Add Vue components into the `components/content/` directory and start using them in Markdown.

See the `<Alert>` component in [`components/content/Alert.vue`](https://github.com/elonehoo/content-unocss/blob/main/theme/components/content/Alert.vue).

By leveraging the [`<ContentSlot>`](https://content.nuxtjs.org/api/components/markdown) component from Nuxt Content, you can use both slots and props in Markdown thanks to the [MDC syntax](https://content.nuxtjs.org/guide/writing/mdc).

```md
::alert{icon="ph:circle-wavy-warning-duotone"}
#title
This is an alert
#default
This is the default content of my alert!
::
```

Will result in:

::alert{icon="ph:circle-wavy-warning-duotone"}
#title
This is an alert
#default
This is the default content of my alert!
::

If you want to go deeper, take a look at the [`<List>`](https://github.com/elonehoo/content-unocss/blob/main/theme/components/content/List.vue) component to see some `useUnwrap()` magic :magic_wand:
